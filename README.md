# Plant-Leaf-Disease-Prediction


-This project focuses on predicting early-stage diseases in plant leaves using deep learning techniques,specifically VGG19 architecture implemented with Keras and TensorFlow.
- The model achieves an accuracy of 88% in identifying diseased plant leaves from images.
- The goal is to assist farmers in identifying potential diseases promptly, thereby enabling timely intervention and effective crop management.
